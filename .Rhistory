# xtabs is use for pulling two columns showing us there stats on a two way table
# one thing xtabs are useful for is they help show us that the various columns being analyzed have
# a good representation e.g at least 30 samples per column or whatever you deem a useful no. of samples
# the first xtab(two way table) compares the gender(sex) against the survival data
xtabs(~Survived + Sex, data = titanic.raw)
# the second xtab(two way table) compares the survival data to passenger class
# ideal you would do this for all the variables you want to input in your model, but it's not necessary tbh

# first i try the Generalized Linear Model(glm) given its popularity working with two way decision analysis
# in this project we predict if someone lived or died
# we will try different models in the future
